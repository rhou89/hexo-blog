## Reaserch Highlights
- Z. Li, X.-W. Luo, D. Lin, A. Gharajeh, J. Moon, **J. Hou**, et al., [Phys. Rev. Lett. **131**, 023202 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.023202).
  - We experimentally realize a topological microlaser via a 1D non-Hermitian AAH photonic lattice of ring cavities.
- F. A. An, B. Sundar, **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **127**, 130401 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.130401). *Editors' Suggestion*
  - We experimentally realize a synthetic lattice in momentum space and show how nonlinear interactions and coherent tunneling lead to rich dyanmics including macroscopic self-trapping and phase-driven Josephson dynamics. The latter was predicted in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. **120**, 120401 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.120401).
- Y.-J. Wu, **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **124**, 227001 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.227001).
  - We discover an experimentally accessible platform, using  a heterostructure of a quantum spin Hall insulator and an s-wave superconductor, for engineering Majorana corner and hinge modes, which are beneficial for topological quantum computing.
- **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **124**, 073603 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.073603).
  - We develop the topological band theory for non-Hermitian hyperbolic metamaterials in continuous limits and reveal it as photonic topological semimetal with triply-degenerate point.
- M. E. Mossman, **J. Hou** et al, [Nat. Commun. **10**, 3381 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11210-z). *Editors' Highlights*
  - We theoretically propose and experimentally realize an atomtronic device called nonmagnetic unidirectional spin switch, in which the direction of spin flip can be controlled in an non-magnetic manner.
- H. Hu, **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **120**, 240401 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.240401).
  - We classify the triply-degenerate point, a "new" kind of fermionic excitation, according to their topological properties.
- **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **120**, 120401 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.120401). *Editors' Suggestion*
  - We demonstrate a bosonic Josephson junction in momentum space. 
  - A relevant experimental realization of the proposed setup: T. M. Bersano, **J. Hou**, et al, [Phys. Rev. A **99**, 051602(R) (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.051602).
- **J. Hou** et al, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **120**, 060407 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.060407).
  - We propose a quantum state of matter called Superfluid-Quasicrystal, which is a superfluid but spontaneously forms quasicrystalline order in real space.
