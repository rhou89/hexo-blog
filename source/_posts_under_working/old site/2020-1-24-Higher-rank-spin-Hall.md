Recently, we have posted a preprint ["Universal intrinsic higher-rank spin Hall effect"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08675) proposing a new family of spin Hall effects, which could be beneficial for spintronic devices. Surprisingly, we received an email from [Emmanuel Rashba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Rashba) the next day, expressing interests in our work and raising a concern based upon his work [Sum rules for spin Hall conductivity cancellation](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.70.201309).

While my advisor knew about this cancellation, it was my first to learn such an effect. Basically, E. Rashba found that a singular term from intraband transitions will lead to exact cancellation of the [d.c. spin-Hall current](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126603). I found this question interesting and suspect that the cancellation should depend on the rank of spin-tensor Hall current, which needs further investigation.
