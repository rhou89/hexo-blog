Recently, I didn't update my notes as frequently as before. One of the reasons is that I'm very busy with my work since I'm about to start my intern. Another important reason is that I've been spending lots of time in taking courses with free certificates on Coursera. As one of the biggest MOOC, Coursera offers many free courses covering a variety of subjects. However, free audit options cannot earn us a certificate even if you follow the instruction and complete all required assignment. If you want the certificate as a proof of your hard work, you have to pay another 50 bucks (the fees vary depending on the course). Now, due to the pandemic situation, more and more people are forced to study and work from home. Coursera also offers free certificate for over 100 courses.

A full list of these coursers can be found [here](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19/). You may register these courses for free until 7/31/2020.

Happy learning and stay healthy!
